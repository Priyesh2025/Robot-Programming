LINE FOLLOWING ROBOT
line_following.py
Package name - pirus_car
front camera added to the car.
First we will operate it using teleope key. - ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
Package used - CV2 : computer vision library.



-----This may be asked in exams------

1] Image Segmentation 
    Two parts - Light and Dark.
    Kind of filter.
    light line = numpy.array([100 , 100 , 100])   # the RGB value < 100 make them all light
    dark line = numpy.array([200 , 200 , 200])   # the RGB value < 200 make them all dark
    mask = inRange(frame , light , )
    

2] Edge detection - (To detect road)
    We use Canny Filter : canny(mask , 40 ,10)
    

3] Line mid Point Estimation (LMP)
    This is for finding mid point of the road.


4] Frame mid point Estimation (FMP)
    Mid point of camera. We have to meseure angle between the LMP and FMP.
    How much stearing we have to rotate(theta) will be counted from inverse kinematics.


5] Controlling the car process
